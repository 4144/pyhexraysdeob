# pyhexraysdeob

This is a port of Rolf Rolles'
[HexRaysDeob](https://github.com/RolfRolles/HexRaysDeob) to
[IDAPython](https://github.com/idapython/src).

This port matches the C++ source code as much as possible on
purpose, and is by no means 'pythonic' Python code. Still, it is a
great way to demonstrate how the 'microcode' API can be used from
IDAPython.
